        <P><strong>Description:</strong></P>
        <p>As a great source of whole grains, oats contain a heart-protective starch called beta-glucan that can help lower high cholesterol and potentially help reduce the risk of certain cancers. (1) Their fiber (and rich texture) make them particularly filling for breakfast, helping you avoid the prelunch call to snack. What’s more, they’re GI-friendly because their fiber content also can help improve digestion and promote regularity.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

        <ul>Old Fashioned oats or rolled oats.</ul>   
        <ul>Milk.</ul>
        <ul>Water.</ul>
        <ul><em>Dash</em> of salt.</ul>
        <ul>Fruit of your choosing:<em> Blueberries, Strawberries, Bananas</em></ul>


        <P><strong>Steps:</strong></P>
        <li>1. Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>2. Reduce heat to low and pour in the oats.</li>
        <li>3. Allow them to cook until they thicken and absorb all the liquid, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>4. Add Fruit of your choosing and <strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
